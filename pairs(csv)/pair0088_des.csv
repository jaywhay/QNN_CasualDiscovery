x = age
y = Relative Spinal bone mineral density
Source:
bone data set from http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ElemStatLearn/ElemStatLearn.pdf
We obtained and preprocessed the data using the following R commands:
install.packages('ElemStatLearn')
library(ElemStatLearn)
for( i in 2:dim(bone)[1] ) { 
  } 
}
remove.packages('ElemStatLearn')
"selected only the columns ""age"" and ""spnbmd"" (Relative Change in Spinal BMD)."
The ground truth should be that age causes relative change in spinal BMD.
