because we believe these encode for missing values. From the UCI ML webpage:
"UPDATE: Until 02/28/2011 the UCI ML web page indicated that there were no
missing values in the dataset. As pointed out by a repository user, this cannot
be true: there are zeros in places where they are biologically impossible, such
as the blood pressure attribute. It seems very likely that zero values encode
missing data. However, since the dataset donors made no such statement we
encourage you to use your best judgement and state your assumptions."
